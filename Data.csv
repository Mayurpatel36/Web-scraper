Square Canada Inc.,2023-01-19T00:00:00,1,"Started using Square in October 2022. Received an email January 19, 2023, telling me that my account is deactivated.  Something about General Terms, which I read and does not make sense. Called customer support and was told that there is no phone number to call for the accounts department in order to find out the problem.  After I questioned some more  I was told to sign up using a different email.  How does this help? No emails from Square and  no one to speak to. I have been SQUARED!Please get the word out   buyer beware."
Square Canada Inc.,2023-01-13T00:00:00,1,"The worst company to deal with they cancel the account with no explanation, and then they hold the my money for 90 to 180days again with no explanation and then, when you call they hang up on you. Apparently there is no more active account. They have nothing to talk about. Meanwhile agan , they hold my money. Unbelievable. Horrible company horrible!!!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-12-30T00:00:00,1,"DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.  Everything is great so long as you never make any changes to your account, or need to call for support. ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE TO DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY.I attempted to apply for their Square card as offered on their website, clicked submit and it failed.  I attempted a second time and thought it was a connection issue.  Now they locked my account due to ""fraud"".  Each time I call, they say they're investigating and it'll be another week, then a week passes and they say it'll be another week. They won't escalate anything, you can't talk to this magical team that is investigating, you can't talk to a supervisor, you just wait while they hold your money hostage.  TRUST ME....DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY....."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-16T00:00:00,1,If I could do zero stars I would . Worst company ever . All I had wanted to do was change my bank account but want able . And customer service is zero. I tried to call numerous times and it directs you to chat . They told me they can’t help me but to call them . But there’s no one to call. So I changed to clover . Way better customer service . You can actually talk with them unlike square.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-12-08T00:00:00,5,"Very easy to use. The devices are not too expensive, neither the fees.  The sales reports are clear. Good consumers service online. Reliable. I use it for years and highly recommend for small businesses!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-09-24T00:00:00,1,"I ordered a Square Terminal after being told it would work at remote craft fairs, with no wifi. Not the case.. so I rejected delivery at the post office. It's stuck in customs now and has been for a month. Customer service was horribly condescending. and kept me on the phone for hours, only to tell me they could do nothing. Their policy is to wait for delivery before stopping the payment plan I arranged, or giving a refund for the one's already made. Basically, I have nothing to show for a $399 before tax, piece of hardware I do not own. As a senior on a fixed income working to make ends meet.. I am an extremely unhappy customer!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-22T00:00:00,1,Square is not user friendly for people with disabilities. I’m blind and they insist on texting and doesn’t allow me to speak with a live agent. I highly do not recommend this company.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-18T00:00:00,1,"Absolutely terrible company, they will hold your money for extended periods while they allocate it to other needs. Huge scam. Do not trust them and do not bother doing business."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-19T00:00:00,1,"Sudden interruption of funds confirmed. First sale on my website & they halted all my brick and mortar business transfers to ""verify"" my account. Online customer service useless. They only tell you to call in & wait for hours. Haven't fixed it days later. Data glitches, expensive equipment. And never link your Etsy. Etsy will take a cut of EVERY transaction on Square, no matter if it's an Etsy sale or not. GO WITH YOUR BANK, no matter how much more it costs! Square is not worth the hassle. I deeply regret this choice."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-07-01T00:00:00,1,Square seemed like a great idea for our website payment gateway until we lost about $7k in chargebacks because they have the worst credit card verification program in the entire world.I went back to PayPal because otherwise Square would keep screwing up.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-23T00:00:00,5,I have had a great experience using Square for my Smale Mental Health Business. The application has helped my business to grow by giving me access to team management and depositing monies directly into my business account. I use their online terminal and invoicing system every day as my business is primarily online. When my business was in-person I used terminals that were of great help to receive payments.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I absolutely love square, the p.o.s. is easy to use, keeps track of all my inventory and people while being very tiny but mighty!! They offer a free e-commerce website and it tracks all of the online and in store purchases and stock. Look no further than Square for your p.o.s system for your small, expanding or large company.Thank you Square team for an amazing product!!! Ideal Treasures Sask"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,Square has been the perfect solution for my small business needs.  I appreciate how easy it is to invoice customers and for them to pay the invoices- my customers have commented how easy this process is.  Loading product up on my website is extremely easy and the site looks great.  Taking payments at in the shop is as easy as clients paying on line for their invoices.  I highly recommend this system.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-20T00:00:00,5,"I tried square and the mag swipe reader at my first crafters event last weekend. Loved it!! It's easy to use, fast processing with my older I-phone, I didn't miss out on any sales, and my customers were impressed with the fact they had a professional looking receipt sent right to them. :) I think I'll be upgrading in the future to the tap reader though."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,"I own a tiny independent business and I am VERY low tech. I sell my goods at craft shows was stressed and intimidated when I realized that I needed to carry out remote points of sale! I am amazed that my experience with Square since I started using it 8 months ago, has been consistently positive! It’s easy to use, customers find it quick and easy to navigate and request a virtual receipt and I absolutely LOVE the Square debit Mastercard!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I love square for my small business! Many different devices for payment options which includes a small, easily transportable device which I use because I travel for work. Great customer service, fair fees and money is always deposited into your account the next day (as opposed to some companies take up to a week).Highly recommend Square!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,I've been very happy using Square for my small business.  Fees are much lower than renting credit card terminals + paying fees on the different credit cards used for payment.  Square simplifies with one rate for credit cards and one fee for debit cards.  They are also cheap to replace if one gets damaged compared to a hand held credit card terminal.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-02T00:00:00,1,"I use to be happy to use square to accept payments with my businesses, until they randomly chose to freeze my account and withhold over $20,000.00 of my hard earned money. This happen 3 weeks ago and no one I speak with can do anything about it. They asked for an invoice with my customers signed signature (which I provided) I was promised that my account would be unlocked after 2 business days and here we are almost a month later and I still have no answer or access to my funds. This is unacceptable and unprofessional. Terrible customer service."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I love square for my Bed and Breakfast Art Gallery business! I am able to get more sales having square that would otherwise have to be cash. I can see at a glance how my business is doing in the reports, making it easy when talking my accountant.  We are also situated a long way from a city center so the direct deposit is great!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,"Square really is the best option for home and small business. They provide a free card reader and simple to use app to get the ball rolling for you. It’s almost like a lifetime trial. Once you’re more established and have time (start up is very busy as it is), you can look at the other options they have to help manage and grow. It’s like having a bookkeeper, CRM expert, marketing consultant, e-commerce expert, web developer, and other staff on hand… but in an app!"

Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-19T00:00:00,1,"Sudden interruption of funds confirmed. First sale on my website & they halted all my brick and mortar business transfers to ""verify"" my account. Online customer service useless. They only tell you to call in & wait for hours. Haven't fixed it days later. Data glitches, expensive equipment. And never link your Etsy. Etsy will take a cut of EVERY transaction on Square, no matter if it's an Etsy sale or not. GO WITH YOUR BANK, no matter how much more it costs! Square is not worth the hassle. I deeply regret this choice."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-07-01T00:00:00,1,Square seemed like a great idea for our website payment gateway until we lost about $7k in chargebacks because they have the worst credit card verification program in the entire world.I went back to PayPal because otherwise Square would keep screwing up.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-23T00:00:00,5,I have had a great experience using Square for my Smale Mental Health Business. The application has helped my business to grow by giving me access to team management and depositing monies directly into my business account. I use their online terminal and invoicing system every day as my business is primarily online. When my business was in-person I used terminals that were of great help to receive payments.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I absolutely love square, the p.o.s. is easy to use, keeps track of all my inventory and people while being very tiny but mighty!! They offer a free e-commerce website and it tracks all of the online and in store purchases and stock. Look no further than Square for your p.o.s system for your small, expanding or large company.Thank you Square team for an amazing product!!! Ideal Treasures Sask"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,Square has been the perfect solution for my small business needs.  I appreciate how easy it is to invoice customers and for them to pay the invoices- my customers have commented how easy this process is.  Loading product up on my website is extremely easy and the site looks great.  Taking payments at in the shop is as easy as clients paying on line for their invoices.  I highly recommend this system.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-20T00:00:00,5,"I tried square and the mag swipe reader at my first crafters event last weekend. Loved it!! It's easy to use, fast processing with my older I-phone, I didn't miss out on any sales, and my customers were impressed with the fact they had a professional looking receipt sent right to them. :) I think I'll be upgrading in the future to the tap reader though."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,"I own a tiny independent business and I am VERY low tech. I sell my goods at craft shows was stressed and intimidated when I realized that I needed to carry out remote points of sale! I am amazed that my experience with Square since I started using it 8 months ago, has been consistently positive! It’s easy to use, customers find it quick and easy to navigate and request a virtual receipt and I absolutely LOVE the Square debit Mastercard!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I love square for my small business! Many different devices for payment options which includes a small, easily transportable device which I use because I travel for work. Great customer service, fair fees and money is always deposited into your account the next day (as opposed to some companies take up to a week).Highly recommend Square!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,I've been very happy using Square for my small business.  Fees are much lower than renting credit card terminals + paying fees on the different credit cards used for payment.  Square simplifies with one rate for credit cards and one fee for debit cards.  They are also cheap to replace if one gets damaged compared to a hand held credit card terminal.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-02T00:00:00,1,"I use to be happy to use square to accept payments with my businesses, until they randomly chose to freeze my account and withhold over $20,000.00 of my hard earned money. This happen 3 weeks ago and no one I speak with can do anything about it. They asked for an invoice with my customers signed signature (which I provided) I was promised that my account would be unlocked after 2 business days and here we are almost a month later and I still have no answer or access to my funds. This is unacceptable and unprofessional. Terrible customer service."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I love square for my Bed and Breakfast Art Gallery business! I am able to get more sales having square that would otherwise have to be cash.

Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,"Square really is the best option for home and small business. They provide a free card reader and simple to use app to get the ball rolling for you. It’s almost like a lifetime trial. Once you’re more established and have time (start up is very busy as it is), you can look at the other options they have to help manage and grow. It’s like having a bookkeeper, CRM expert, marketing consultant, e-commerce expert, web developer, and other staff on hand… but in an app!"

Something about General Terms, which I read and does not make sense. Called customer support and was told that there is no phone number to call for the accounts department in order to find out the problem.  After I questioned some more  I was told to sign up using a different email.  How does this help? No emails from Square and  no one to speak to. I have been SQUARED!Please get the word out   buyer beware."
Square Canada Inc.,2023-01-13T00:00:00,1,"The worst company to deal with they cancel the account with no explanation, and then they hold the my money for 90 to 180days again with no explanation and then, when you call they hang up on you. Apparently there is no more active account. They have nothing to talk about. Meanwhile agan , they hold my money. Unbelievable. Horrible company horrible!!!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-12-30T00:00:00,1,"DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.

ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE TO DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY.I attempted to apply for their Square card as offered on their website, clicked submit and it failed.  I attempted a second time and thought it was a connection issue.  Now they locked my account due to ""fraud"".  Each time I call, they say they're investigating and it'll be another week, then a week passes and they say it'll be another week. They won't escalate anything, you can't talk to this magical team that is investigating, you can't talk to a supervisor, you just wait while they hold your money hostage.  TRUST ME....DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY....."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-16T00:00:00,1,If I could do zero stars I would . Worst company ever . All I had wanted to do was change my bank account but want able . And customer service is zero. I tried to call numerous times and it directs you to chat . They told me they can’t help me but to call them . But there’s no one to call. So I changed to clover . Way better customer service . You can actually talk with them unlike square.

Great customer service, fair fees and money is always deposited into your account the next day (as opposed to some companies take up to a week).Highly recommend Square!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,I've been very happy using Square for my small business.  Fees are much lower than renting credit card terminals + paying fees on the different credit cards used for payment.  Square simplifies with one rate for credit cards and one fee for debit cards.  They are also cheap to replace if one gets damaged compared to a hand held credit card terminal.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-02T00:00:00,1,"I use to be happy to use square to accept payments with my businesses, until they randomly chose to freeze my account and withhold over $20,000.00 of my hard earned money. This happen 3 weeks ago and no one I speak with can do anything about it. They asked for an invoice with my customers signed signature (which I provided) I was promised that my account would be unlocked after 2 business days and here we are almost a month later and I still have no answer or access to my funds. This is unacceptable and unprofessional. Terrible customer service."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I love square for my Bed and Breakfast Art Gallery business! I am able to get more sales having square that would otherwise have to be cash. I can see at a glance how my business is doing in the reports, making it easy when talking my accountant.  We are also situated a long way from a city center so the direct deposit is great!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,"Square really is the best option for home and small business. They provide a free card reader and simple to use app to get the ball rolling for you. It’s almost like a lifetime trial. Once you’re more established and have time (start up is very busy as it is), you can look at the other options they have to help manage and grow. It’s like having a bookkeeper, CRM expert, marketing consultant, e-commerce expert, web developer, and other staff on hand… but in an app!"
Square Canada Inc.,2023-01-19T00:00:00,1,"Started using Square in October 2022. Received an email January 19, 2023, telling me that my account is deactivated.  Something about General Terms, which I read and does not make sense. Called customer support and was told that there is no phone number to call for the accounts department in order to find out the problem.  After I questioned some more  I was told to sign up using a different email.  How does this help? No emails from Square and  no one to speak to. I have been SQUARED!Please get the word out   buyer beware."
Square Canada Inc.,2023-01-13T00:00:00,1,"The worst company to deal with they cancel the account with no explanation, and then they hold the my money for 90 to 180days again with no explanation and then, when you call they hang up on you. Apparently there is no more active account. They have nothing to talk about. Meanwhile agan , they hold my money. Unbelievable. Horrible company horrible!!!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-12-30T00:00:00,1,"DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.  Everything is great so long as you never make any changes to your account, or need to call for support. ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE TO DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY.I attempted to apply for their Square card as offered on their website, clicked submit and it failed.  I attempted a second time and thought it was a connection issue.  Now they locked my account due to ""fraud"".  Each time I call, they say they're investigating and it'll be another week, then a week passes and they say it'll be another week. They won't escalate anything, you can't talk to this magical team that is investigating, you can't talk to a supervisor, you just wait while they hold your money hostage.  TRUST ME....DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY....."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-16T00:00:00,1,If I could do zero stars I would . Worst company ever . All I had wanted to do was change my bank account but want able . And customer service is zero. I tried to call numerous times and it directs you to chat . They told me they can’t help me but to call them . But there’s no one to call. So I changed to clover . Way better customer service . You can actually talk with them unlike square.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-12-08T00:00:00,5,"Very easy to use. The devices are not too expensive, neither the fees.  The sales reports are clear. Good consumers service online. Reliable. I use it for years and highly recommend for small businesses!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-09-24T00:00:00,1,"I ordered a Square Terminal after being told it would work at remote craft fairs, with no wifi. Not the case.. so I rejected delivery at the post office. It's stuck in customs now and has been for a month. Customer service was horribly condescending. and kept me on the phone for hours, only to tell me they could do nothing. Their policy is to wait for delivery before stopping the payment plan I arranged, or giving a refund for the one's already made. Basically, I have nothing to show for a $399 before tax, piece of hardware I do not own. As a senior on a fixed income working to make ends meet.. I am an extremely unhappy customer!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-22T00:00:00,1,Square is not user friendly for people with disabilities. I’m blind and they insist on texting and doesn’t allow me to speak with a live agent. I highly do not recommend this company.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-18T00:00:00,1,"Absolutely terrible company, they will hold your money for extended periods while they allocate it to other needs. Huge scam. Do not trust them and do not bother doing business."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-19T00:00:00,1,"Sudden interruption of funds confirmed. First sale on my website & they halted all my brick and mortar business transfers to ""verify"" my account. Online customer service useless. They only tell you to call in & wait for hours. Haven't fixed it days later. Data glitches, expensive equipment. And never link your Etsy. Etsy will take a cut of EVERY transaction on Square, no matter if it's an Etsy sale or not. GO WITH YOUR BANK, no matter how much more it costs! Square is not worth the hassle. I deeply regret this choice."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-07-01T00:00:00,1,Square seemed like a great idea for our website payment gateway until we lost about $7k in chargebacks because they have the worst credit card verification program in the entire world.I went back to PayPal because otherwise Square would keep screwing up.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-23T00:00:00,5,I have had a great experience using Square for my Smale Mental Health Business. The application has helped my business to grow by giving me access to team management and depositing monies directly into my business account. I use their online terminal and invoicing system every day as my business is primarily online. When my business was in-person I used terminals that were of great help to receive payments.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I absolutely love square, the p.o.s. is easy to use, keeps track of all my inventory and people while being very tiny but mighty!!

Loading product up on my website is extremely easy and the site looks great.  Taking payments at in the shop is as easy as clients paying on line for their invoices.  I highly recommend this system.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-20T00:00:00,5,"I tried square and the mag swipe reader at my first crafters event last weekend. Loved it!!

Each time I call, they say they're investigating and it'll be another week, then a week passes and they say it'll be another week. They won't escalate anything, you can't talk to this magical team that is investigating, you can't talk to a supervisor, you just wait while they hold your money hostage.  TRUST ME....DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY....."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-16T00:00:00,1,If I could do zero stars I would . Worst company ever . All I had wanted to do was change my bank account but want able . And customer service is zero. I tried to call numerous times and it directs you to chat . They told me they can’t help me but to call them . But there’s no one to call. So I changed to clover . Way better customer service . You can actually talk with them unlike square.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-12-08T00:00:00,5,"Very easy to use. The devices are not too expensive, neither the fees.  The sales reports are clear. Good consumers service online. Reliable. I use it for years and highly recommend for small businesses!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-09-24T00:00:00,1,"I ordered a Square Terminal after being told it would work at remote craft fairs, with no wifi. Not the case.. so I rejected delivery at the post office. It's stuck in customs now and has been for a month. Customer service was horribly condescending. and kept me on the phone for hours, only to tell me they could do nothing. Their policy is to wait for delivery before stopping the payment plan I arranged, or giving a refund for the one's already made. Basically, I have nothing to show for a $399 before tax, piece of hardware I do not own. As a senior on a fixed income working to make ends meet.. I am an extremely unhappy customer!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-22T00:00:00,1,Square is not user friendly for people with disabilities. I’m blind and they insist on texting and doesn’t allow me to speak with a live agent. I highly do not recommend this company.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-18T00:00:00,1,"Absolutely terrible company, they will hold your money for extended periods while they allocate it to other needs. Huge scam. Do not trust them and do not bother doing business."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-19T00:00:00,1,"Sudden interruption of funds confirmed. First sale on my website & they halted all my brick and mortar business transfers to ""verify"" my account. Online customer service useless. They only tell you to call in & wait for hours. Haven't fixed it days later. Data glitches, expensive equipment. And never link your Etsy. Etsy will take a cut of EVERY transaction on Square, no matter if it's an Etsy sale or not. GO WITH YOUR BANK, no matter how much more it costs! Square is not worth the hassle. I deeply regret this choice."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-07-01T00:00:00,1,Square seemed like a great idea for our website payment gateway until we lost about $7k in chargebacks because they have the worst credit card verification program in the entire world.I went back to PayPal because otherwise Square would keep screwing up.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-23T00:00:00,5,I have had a great experience using Square for my Smale Mental Health Business. The application has helped my business to grow by giving me access to team management and depositing monies directly into my business account. I use their online terminal and invoicing system every day as my business is primarily online. When my business was in-person I used terminals that were of great help to receive payments.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I absolutely love square, the p.o.s. is easy to use, keeps track of all my inventory and people while being very tiny but mighty!! They offer a free e-commerce website and it tracks all of the online and in store purchases and stock. Look no further than Square for your p.o.s system for your small, expanding or large company.Thank you Square team for an amazing product!!! Ideal Treasures Sask"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,Square has been the perfect solution for my small business needs.  I appreciate how easy it is to invoice customers and for them to pay the invoices- my customers have commented how easy this process is.  Loading product up on my website is extremely easy and the site looks great.  Taking payments at in the shop is as easy as clients paying on line for their invoices.  I highly recommend this system.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-20T00:00:00,5,"I tried square and the mag swipe reader at my first crafters event last weekend. Loved it!! It's easy to use, fast processing with my older I-phone, I didn't miss out on any sales, and my customers were impressed with the fact they had a professional looking receipt sent right to them. :) I think I'll be upgrading in the future to the tap reader though."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,"I own a tiny independent business and I am VERY low tech. I sell my goods at craft shows was stressed and intimidated when I realized that I needed to carry out remote points of sale! I am amazed that my experience with Square since I started using it 8 months ago, has been consistently positive! It’s easy to use, customers find it quick and easy to navigate and request a virtual receipt and I absolutely LOVE the Square debit Mastercard!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I love square for my small business! Many different devices for payment options which includes a small, easily transportable device which I use because I travel for work. Great customer service, fair fees and money is always deposited into your account the next day (as opposed to some companies take up to a week).Highly recommend Square!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,I've been very happy using Square for my small business.  Fees are much lower than renting credit card terminals + paying fees on the different credit cards used for payment.  Square simplifies with one rate for credit cards and one fee for debit cards.  They are also cheap to replace if one gets damaged compared to a hand held credit card terminal.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-02T00:00:00,1,"I use to be happy to use square to accept payments with my businesses, until they randomly chose to freeze my account and withhold over $20,000.00 of my hard earned money. This happen 3 weeks ago and no one I speak with can do anything about it. They asked for an invoice with my customers signed signature (which I provided) I was promised that my account would be unlocked after 2 business days and here we are almost a month later and I still have no answer or access to my funds. This is unacceptable and unprofessional. Terrible customer service."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I love square for my Bed and Breakfast Art Gallery business! I am able to get more sales having square that would otherwise have to be cash.

Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,"Square really is the best option for home and small business. They provide a free card reader and simple to use app to get the ball rolling for you. It’s almost like a lifetime trial. Once you’re more established and have time (start up is very busy as it is), you can look at the other options they have to help manage and grow.

Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I absolutely love square, the p.o.s. is easy to use, keeps track of all my inventory and people while being very tiny but mighty!! They offer a free e-commerce website and it tracks all of the online and in store purchases and stock. Look no further than Square for your p.o.s system for your small, expanding or large company.Thank you Square team for an amazing product!!! Ideal Treasures Sask"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,Square has been the perfect solution for my small business needs.  I appreciate how easy it is to invoice customers and for them to pay the invoices- my customers have commented how easy this process is.  Loading product up on my website is extremely easy and the site looks great.  Taking payments at in the shop is as easy as clients paying on line for their invoices.  I highly recommend this system.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-20T00:00:00,5,"I tried square and the mag swipe reader at my first crafters event last weekend. Loved it!! It's easy to use, fast processing with my older I-phone, I didn't miss out on any sales, and my customers were impressed with the fact they had a professional looking receipt sent right to them. :) I think I'll be upgrading in the future to the tap reader though."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,"I own a tiny independent business and I am VERY low tech. I sell my goods at craft shows was stressed and intimidated when I realized that I needed to carry out remote points of sale! I am amazed that my experience with Square since I started using it 8 months ago, has been consistently positive! It’s easy to use, customers find it quick and easy to navigate and request a virtual receipt and I absolutely LOVE the Square debit Mastercard!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I love square for my small business! Many different devices for payment options which includes a small, easily transportable device which I use because I travel for work. Great customer service, fair fees and money is always deposited into your account the next day (as opposed to some companies take up to a week).Highly recommend Square!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,I've been very happy using Square for my small business.  Fees are much lower than renting credit card terminals + paying fees on the different credit cards used for payment.  Square simplifies with one rate for credit cards and one fee for debit cards.  They are also cheap to replace if one gets damaged compared to a hand held credit card terminal.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-02T00:00:00,1,"I use to be happy to use square to accept payments with my businesses, until they randomly chose to freeze my account and withhold over $20,000.00 of my hard earned money. This happen 3 weeks ago and no one I speak with can do anything about it. They asked for an invoice with my customers signed signature (which I provided) I was promised that my account would be unlocked after 2 business days and here we are almost a month later and I still have no answer or access to my funds. This is unacceptable and unprofessional. Terrible customer service."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I love square for my Bed and Breakfast Art Gallery business! I am able to get more sales having square that would otherwise have to be cash. I can see at a glance how my business is doing in the reports, making it easy when talking my accountant.  We are also situated a long way from a city center so the direct deposit is great!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,"Square really is the best option for home and small business. They provide a free card reader and simple to use app to get the ball rolling for you. It’s almost like a lifetime trial. Once you’re more established and have time (start up is very busy as it is), you can look at the other options they have to help manage and grow. It’s like having a bookkeeper, CRM expert, marketing consultant, e-commerce expert, web developer, and other staff on hand… but in an app!"
Square Canada Inc.,2023-01-19T00:00:00,1,"Started using Square in October 2022. Received an email January 19, 2023, telling me that my account is deactivated.  Something about General Terms, which I read and does not make sense. Called customer support and was told that there is no phone number to call for the accounts department in order to find out the problem.  After I questioned some more  I was told to sign up using a different email.  How does this help? No emails from Square and  no one to speak to. I have been SQUARED!Please get the word out   buyer beware."
Square Canada Inc.,2023-01-13T00:00:00,1,"The worst company to deal with they cancel the account with no explanation, and then they hold the my money for 90 to 180days again with no explanation and then, when you call they hang up on you. Apparently there is no more active account. They have nothing to talk about. Meanwhile agan , they hold my money. Unbelievable. Horrible company horrible!!!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-12-30T00:00:00,1,"DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.  Everything is great so long as you never make any changes to your account, or need to call for support. ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE TO DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY.I attempted to apply for their Square card as offered on their website, clicked submit and it failed.  I attempted a second time and thought it was a connection issue.  Now they locked my account due to ""fraud"".  Each time I call, they say they're investigating and it'll be another week, then a week passes and they say it'll be another week. They won't escalate anything, you can't talk to this magical team that is investigating, you can't talk to a supervisor, you just wait while they hold your money hostage.  TRUST ME....DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY....."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-16T00:00:00,1,If I could do zero stars I would . Worst company ever . All I had wanted to do was change my bank account but want able . And customer service is zero. I tried to call numerous times and it directs you to chat . They told me they can’t help me but to call them . But there’s no one to call. So I changed to clover . Way better customer service . You can actually talk with them unlike square.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-12-08T00:00:00,5,"Very easy to use. The devices are not too expensive, neither the fees.  The sales reports are clear. Good consumers service online. Reliable. I use it for years and highly recommend for small businesses!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-09-24T00:00:00,1,"I ordered a Square Terminal after being told it would work at remote craft fairs, with no wifi. Not the case.. so I rejected delivery at the post office. It's stuck in customs now and has been for a month. Customer service was horribly condescending. and kept me on the phone for hours, only to tell me they could do nothing. Their policy is to wait for delivery before stopping the payment plan I arranged, or giving a refund for the one's already made. Basically, I have nothing to show for a $399 before tax, piece of hardware I do not own. As a senior on a fixed income working to make ends meet.. I am an extremely unhappy customer!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-22T00:00:00,1,Square is not user friendly for people with disabilities. I’m blind and they insist on texting and doesn’t allow me to speak with a live agent. I highly do not recommend this company.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-18T00:00:00,1,"Absolutely terrible company, they will hold your money for extended periods while they allocate it to other needs. Huge scam. Do not trust them and do not bother doing business."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-19T00:00:00,1,"Sudden interruption of funds confirmed. First sale on my website & they halted all my brick and mortar business transfers to ""verify"" my account. Online customer service useless. They only tell you to call in & wait for hours. Haven't fixed it days later. Data glitches, expensive equipment. And never link your Etsy. Etsy will take a cut of EVERY transaction on Square, no matter if it's an Etsy sale or not. GO WITH YOUR BANK, no matter how much more it costs! Square is not worth the hassle. I deeply regret this choice."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-07-01T00:00:00,1,Square seemed like a great idea for our website payment gateway until we lost about $7k in chargebacks because they have the worst credit card verification program in the entire world.I went back to PayPal because otherwise Square would keep screwing up.

Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,"Square really is the best option for home and small business. They provide a free card reader and simple to use app to get the ball rolling for you. It’s almost like a lifetime trial. Once you’re more established and have time (start up is very busy as it is), you can look at the other options they have to help manage and grow. It’s like having a bookkeeper, CRM expert, marketing consultant, e-commerce expert, web developer, and other staff on hand… but in an app!"
Square Canada Inc.,2023-01-19T00:00:00,1,"Started using Square in October 2022. Received an email January 19, 2023, telling me that my account is deactivated.  Something about General Terms, which I read and does not make sense. Called customer support and was told that there is no phone number to call for the accounts department in order to find out the problem.  After I questioned some more  I was told to sign up using a different email.  How does this help? No emails from Square and  no one to speak to. I have been SQUARED!Please get the word out   buyer beware."
Square Canada Inc.,2023-01-13T00:00:00,1,"The worst company to deal with they cancel the account with no explanation, and then they hold the my money for 90 to 180days again with no explanation and then, when you call they hang up on you. Apparently there is no more active account. They have nothing to talk about. Meanwhile agan , they hold my money. Unbelievable. Horrible company horrible!!!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-12-30T00:00:00,1,"DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.  Everything is great so long as you never make any changes to your account, or need to call for support. ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE TO DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY.I attempted to apply for their Square card as offered on their website, clicked submit and it failed.  I attempted a second time and thought it was a connection issue.  Now they locked my account due to ""fraud"".  Each time I call, they say they're investigating and it'll be another week, then a week passes and they say it'll be another week. They won't escalate anything, you can't talk to this magical team that is investigating, you can't talk to a supervisor, you just wait while they hold your money hostage.  TRUST ME....DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY....."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-16T00:00:00,1,If I could do zero stars I would . Worst company ever . All I had wanted to do was change my bank account but want able . And customer service is zero. I tried to call numerous times and it directs you to chat . They told me they can’t help me but to call them . But there’s no one to call. So I changed to clover . Way better customer service . You can actually talk with them unlike square.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-12-08T00:00:00,5,"Very easy to use. The devices are not too expensive, neither the fees.  The sales reports are clear. Good consumers service online. Reliable. I use it for years and highly recommend for small businesses!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-09-24T00:00:00,1,"I ordered a Square Terminal after being told it would work at remote craft fairs, with no wifi. Not the case.. so I rejected delivery at the post office.

Their policy is to wait for delivery before stopping the payment plan I arranged, or giving a refund for the one's already made. Basically, I have nothing to show for a $399 before tax, piece of hardware I do not own. As a senior on a fixed income working to make ends meet.. I am an extremely unhappy customer!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-22T00:00:00,1,Square is not user friendly for people with disabilities. I’m blind and they insist on texting and doesn’t allow me to speak with a live agent. I highly do not recommend this company.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-18T00:00:00,1,"Absolutely terrible company, they will hold your money for extended periods while they allocate it to other needs. Huge scam. Do not trust them and do not bother doing business."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-19T00:00:00,1,"Sudden interruption of funds confirmed. First sale on my website & they halted all my brick and mortar business transfers to ""verify"" my account. Online customer service useless. They only tell you to call in & wait for hours. Haven't fixed it days later. Data glitches, expensive equipment. And never link your Etsy. Etsy will take a cut of EVERY transaction on Square, no matter if it's an Etsy sale or not. GO WITH YOUR BANK, no matter how much more it costs! Square is not worth the hassle. I deeply regret this choice."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-07-01T00:00:00,1,Square seemed like a great idea for our website payment gateway until we lost about $7k in chargebacks because they have the worst credit card verification program in the entire world.I went back to PayPal because otherwise Square would keep screwing up.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-23T00:00:00,5,I have had a great experience using Square for my Smale Mental Health Business. The application has helped my business to grow by giving me access to team management and depositing monies directly into my business account. I use their online terminal and invoicing system every day as my business is primarily online. When my business was in-person I used terminals that were of great help to receive payments.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I absolutely love square, the p.o.s. is easy to use, keeps track of all my inventory and people while being very tiny but mighty!! They offer a free e-commerce website and it tracks all of the online and in store purchases and stock. Look no further than Square for your p.o.s system for your small, expanding or large company.Thank you Square team for an amazing product!!! Ideal Treasures Sask"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,Square has been the perfect solution for my small business needs.  I appreciate how easy it is to invoice customers and for them to pay the invoices- my customers have commented how easy this process is.  Loading product up on my website is extremely easy and the site looks great.  Taking payments at in the shop is as easy as clients paying on line for their invoices.  I highly recommend this system.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-20T00:00:00,5,"I tried square and the mag swipe reader at my first crafters event last weekend. Loved it!! It's easy to use, fast processing with my older I-phone, I didn't miss out on any sales, and my customers were impressed with the fact they had a professional looking receipt sent right to them. :) I think I'll be upgrading in the future to the tap reader though."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,"I own a tiny independent business and I am VERY low tech. I sell my goods at craft shows was stressed and intimidated when I realized that I needed to carry out remote points of sale! I am amazed that my experience with Square since I started using it 8 months ago, has been consistently positive! It’s easy to use, customers find it quick and easy to navigate and request a virtual receipt and I absolutely LOVE the Square debit Mastercard!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I love square for my small business! Many different devices for payment options which includes a small, easily transportable device which I use because I travel for work. Great customer service, fair fees and money is always deposited into your account the next day (as opposed to some companies take up to a week).Highly recommend Square!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,I've been very happy using Square for my small business.  Fees are much lower than renting credit card terminals + paying fees on the different credit cards used for payment.  Square simplifies with one rate for credit cards and one fee for debit cards.  They are also cheap to replace if one gets damaged compared to a hand held credit card terminal.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-02T00:00:00,1,"I use to be happy to use square to accept payments with my businesses, until they randomly chose to freeze my account and withhold over $20,000.00 of my hard earned money.

It's stuck in customs now and has been for a month. Customer service was horribly condescending. and kept me on the phone for hours, only to tell me they could do nothing. Their policy is to wait for delivery before stopping the payment plan I arranged, or giving a refund for the one's already made. Basically, I have nothing to show for a $399 before tax, piece of hardware I do not own. As a senior on a fixed income working to make ends meet.. I am an extremely unhappy customer!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-22T00:00:00,1,Square is not user friendly for people with disabilities. I’m blind and they insist on texting and doesn’t allow me to speak with a live agent. I highly do not recommend this company.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-18T00:00:00,1,"Absolutely terrible company, they will hold your money for extended periods while they allocate it to other needs. Huge scam. Do not trust them and do not bother doing business."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-19T00:00:00,1,"Sudden interruption of funds confirmed. First sale on my website & they halted all my brick and mortar business transfers to ""verify"" my account. Online customer service useless. They only tell you to call in & wait for hours. Haven't fixed it days later. Data glitches, expensive equipment. And never link your Etsy. Etsy will take a cut of EVERY transaction on Square, no matter if it's an Etsy sale or not. GO WITH YOUR BANK, no matter how much more it costs! Square is not worth the hassle. I deeply regret this choice."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-07-01T00:00:00,1,Square seemed like a great idea for our website payment gateway until we lost about $7k in chargebacks because they have the worst credit card verification program in the entire world.I went back to PayPal because otherwise Square would keep screwing up.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-23T00:00:00,5,I have had a great experience using Square for my Smale Mental Health Business. The application has helped my business to grow by giving me access to team management and depositing monies directly into my business account. I use their online terminal and invoicing system every day as my business is primarily online. When my business was in-person I used terminals that were of great help to receive payments.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I absolutely love square, the p.o.s. is easy to use, keeps track of all my inventory and people while being very tiny but mighty!! They offer a free e-commerce website and it tracks all of the online and in store purchases and stock. Look no further than Square for your p.o.s system for your small, expanding or large company.Thank you Square team for an amazing product!!! Ideal Treasures Sask"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,Square has been the perfect solution for my small business needs.  I appreciate how easy it is to invoice customers and for them to pay the invoices- my customers have commented how easy this process is.  Loading product up on my website is extremely easy and the site looks great.  Taking payments at in the shop is as easy as clients paying on line for their invoices.  I highly recommend this system.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-20T00:00:00,5,"I tried square and the mag swipe reader at my first crafters event last weekend. Loved it!! It's easy to use, fast processing with my older I-phone, I didn't miss out on any sales, and my customers were impressed with the fact they had a professional looking receipt sent right to them. :) I think I'll be upgrading in the future to the tap reader though."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,"I own a tiny independent business and I am VERY low tech. I sell my goods at craft shows was stressed and intimidated when I realized that I needed to carry out remote points of sale! I am amazed that my experience with Square since I started using it 8 months ago, has been consistently positive! It’s easy to use, customers find it quick and easy to navigate and request a virtual receipt and I absolutely LOVE the Square debit Mastercard!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I love square for my small business! Many different devices for payment options which includes a small, easily transportable device which I use because I travel for work. Great customer service, fair fees and money is always deposited into your account the next day (as opposed to some companies take up to a week).Highly recommend Square!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,I've been very happy using Square for my small business.  Fees are much lower than renting credit card terminals + paying fees on the different credit cards used for payment.  Square simplifies with one rate for credit cards and one fee for debit cards.  They are also cheap to replace if one gets damaged compared to a hand held credit card terminal.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-02T00:00:00,1,"I use to be happy to use square to accept payments with my businesses, until they randomly chose to freeze my account and withhold over $20,000.00 of my hard earned money. This happen 3 weeks ago and no one I speak with can do anything about it. They asked for an invoice with my customers signed signature (which I provided) I was promised that my account would be unlocked after 2 business days and here we are almost a month later and I still have no answer or access to my funds. This is unacceptable and unprofessional. Terrible customer service."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I love square for my Bed and Breakfast Art Gallery business! I am able to get more sales having square that would otherwise have to be cash. I can see at a glance how my business is doing in the reports, making it easy when talking my accountant.  We are also situated a long way from a city center so the direct deposit is great!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,"Square really is the best option for home and small business. They provide a free card reader and simple to use app to get the ball rolling for you. It’s almost like a lifetime trial. Once you’re more established and have time (start up is very busy as it is), you can look at the other options they have to help manage and grow. It’s like having a bookkeeper, CRM expert, marketing consultant, e-commerce expert, web developer, and other staff on hand… but in an app!"
Square Canada Inc.,2023-01-19T00:00:00,1,"Started using Square in October 2022. Received an email January 19, 2023, telling me that my account is deactivated.  Something about General Terms, which I read and does not make sense. Called customer support and was told that there is no phone number to call for the accounts department in order to find out the problem.  After I questioned some more  I was told to sign up using a different email.  How does this help? No emails from Square and  no one to speak to. I have been SQUARED!Please get the word out   buyer beware."
Square Canada Inc.,2023-01-13T00:00:00,1,"The worst company to deal with they cancel the account with no explanation, and then they hold the my money for 90 to 180days again with no explanation and then, when you call they hang up on you. Apparently there is no more active account. They have nothing to talk about. Meanwhile agan , they hold my money. Unbelievable. Horrible company horrible!!!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-12-30T00:00:00,1,"DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.

ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE TO DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY.I attempted to apply for their Square card as offered on their website, clicked submit and it failed.  I attempted a second time and thought it was a connection issue.  Now they locked my account due to ""fraud"".  Each time I call, they say they're investigating and it'll be another week, then a week passes and they say it'll be another week. They won't escalate anything, you can't talk to this magical team that is investigating, you can't talk to a supervisor, you just wait while they hold your money hostage.  TRUST ME....DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY....."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-16T00:00:00,1,If I could do zero stars I would . Worst company ever . All I had wanted to do was change my bank account but want able . And customer service is zero.

It's easy to use, fast processing with my older I-phone, I didn't miss out on any sales, and my customers were impressed with the fact they had a professional looking receipt sent right to them. :) I think I'll be upgrading in the future to the tap reader though."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,"I own a tiny independent business and I am VERY low tech. I sell my goods at craft shows was stressed and intimidated when I realized that I needed to carry out remote points of sale! I am amazed that my experience with Square since I started using it 8 months ago, has been consistently positive! It’s easy to use, customers find it quick and easy to navigate and request a virtual receipt and I absolutely LOVE the Square debit Mastercard!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I love square for my small business! Many different devices for payment options which includes a small, easily transportable device which I use because I travel for work. Great customer service, fair fees and money is always deposited into your account the next day (as opposed to some companies take up to a week).Highly recommend Square!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,I've been very happy using Square for my small business.  Fees are much lower than renting credit card terminals + paying fees on the different credit cards used for payment.  Square simplifies with one rate for credit cards and one fee for debit cards.  They are also cheap to replace if one gets damaged compared to a hand held credit card terminal.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-02T00:00:00,1,"I use to be happy to use square to accept payments with my businesses, until they randomly chose to freeze my account and withhold over $20,000.00 of my hard earned money. This happen 3 weeks ago and no one I speak with can do anything about it. They asked for an invoice with my customers signed signature (which I provided) I was promised that my account would be unlocked after 2 business days and here we are almost a month later and I still have no answer or access to my funds. This is unacceptable and unprofessional. Terrible customer service."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I love square for my Bed and Breakfast Art Gallery business! I am able to get more sales having square that would otherwise have to be cash. I can see at a glance how my business is doing in the reports, making it easy when talking my accountant.  We are also situated a long way from a city center so the direct deposit is great!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-16T00:00:00,5,"Square really is the best option for home and small business. They provide a free card reader and simple to use app to get the ball rolling for you. It’s almost like a lifetime trial. Once you’re more established and have time (start up is very busy as it is), you can look at the other options they have to help manage and grow. It’s like having a bookkeeper, CRM expert, marketing consultant, e-commerce expert, web developer, and other staff on hand… but in an app!"
Square Canada Inc.,2023-01-19T00:00:00,1,"Started using Square in October 2022. Received an email January 19, 2023, telling me that my account is deactivated.  Something about General Terms, which I read and does not make sense. Called customer support and was told that there is no phone number to call for the accounts department in order to find out the problem.  After I questioned some more  I was told to sign up using a different email.  How does this help? No emails from Square and  no one to speak to. I have been SQUARED!Please get the word out   buyer beware."
Square Canada Inc.,2023-01-13T00:00:00,1,"The worst company to deal with they cancel the account with no explanation, and then they hold the my money for 90 to 180days again with no explanation and then, when you call they hang up on you. Apparently there is no more active account. They have nothing to talk about. Meanwhile agan , they hold my money. Unbelievable. Horrible company horrible!!!!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-12-30T00:00:00,1,"DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.  Everything is great so long as you never make any changes to your account, or need to call for support. ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE TO DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY.I attempted to apply for their Square card as offered on their website, clicked submit and it failed.  I attempted a second time and thought it was a connection issue.  Now they locked my account due to ""fraud"".  Each time I call, they say they're investigating and it'll be another week, then a week passes and they say it'll be another week. They won't escalate anything, you can't talk to this magical team that is investigating, you can't talk to a supervisor, you just wait while they hold your money hostage.  TRUST ME....DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY....."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-16T00:00:00,1,If I could do zero stars I would . Worst company ever . All I had wanted to do was change my bank account but want able . And customer service is zero. I tried to call numerous times and it directs you to chat . They told me they can’t help me but to call them . But there’s no one to call. So I changed to clover . Way better customer service . You can actually talk with them unlike square.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-12-08T00:00:00,5,"Very easy to use. The devices are not too expensive, neither the fees.  The sales reports are clear. Good consumers service online. Reliable. I use it for years and highly recommend for small businesses!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-09-24T00:00:00,1,"I ordered a Square Terminal after being told it would work at remote craft fairs, with no wifi. Not the case.. so I rejected delivery at the post office. It's stuck in customs now and has been for a month. Customer service was horribly condescending. and kept me on the phone for hours, only to tell me they could do nothing. Their policy is to wait for delivery before stopping the payment plan I arranged, or giving a refund for the one's already made. Basically, I have nothing to show for a $399 before tax, piece of hardware I do not own. As a senior on a fixed income working to make ends meet.. I am an extremely unhappy customer!"
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-22T00:00:00,1,Square is not user friendly for people with disabilities. I’m blind and they insist on texting and doesn’t allow me to speak with a live agent. I highly do not recommend this company.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-11-18T00:00:00,1,"Absolutely terrible company, they will hold your money for extended periods while they allocate it to other needs. Huge scam. Do not trust them and do not bother doing business."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-08-19T00:00:00,1,"Sudden interruption of funds confirmed. First sale on my website & they halted all my brick and mortar business transfers to ""verify"" my account. Online customer service useless. They only tell you to call in & wait for hours. Haven't fixed it days later. Data glitches, expensive equipment. And never link your Etsy. Etsy will take a cut of EVERY transaction on Square, no matter if it's an Etsy sale or not. GO WITH YOUR BANK, no matter how much more it costs! Square is not worth the hassle. I deeply regret this choice."
Square Canada Inc.,2022-07-01T00:00:00,1,Square seemed like a great idea for our website payment gateway until we lost about $7k in chargebacks because they have the worst credit card verification program in the entire world.I went back to PayPal because otherwise Square would keep screwing up.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-23T00:00:00,5,I have had a great experience using Square for my Smale Mental Health Business. The application has helped my business to grow by giving me access to team management and depositing monies directly into my business account. I use their online terminal and invoicing system every day as my business is primarily online. When my business was in-person I used terminals that were of great help to receive payments.
Square Canada Inc.,2022-06-22T00:00:00,5,"I absolutely love square, the p.o.s. is easy to use, keeps track of all my inventory and people while being very tiny but mighty!!
